## Thinking in React
- Planning and drawing boxes around everything
- Component Hierarchy
- Build Static Components

## Props
- Props are passed to other components and can only flow down (passed from parent)
- What does the props object look like?
- Like parameters to the function
- Props are read only

## Object Destructuring
